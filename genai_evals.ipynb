A higher rating indicates better waterproofing. Look for tents with a hydrostatic head rating of at least 1,500mm for the rainfly and 3,000mm for the tent floor for good waterproof performance.\\n\\nUltimately, the most waterproof tent for you will depend on your specific needs, such as the type of environment you'll be camping in, the season, and the weight you are willing to carry.
